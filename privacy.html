    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="branded">Effective Date: November 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the “Automation” web application (“we”, “us”, “our”), developed and operated as an individual project. Our app lets users automate Instagram DMs and comment replies through the Instagram API for marketing, customer support, and engagement purposes.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the most recent chat messages from connected Instagram accounts for the purpose of automation. <b>No personal user information</b> (such as Instagram username, profile picture, or other identifying details) is stored or processed by our service.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>Collected chat messages are solely used to remember the chat context and to provide better automated responses within your Instagram account. We do not use this data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <b>not</b> share any collected information with third parties or external services, except for integration with OpenAI for AI-powered features. All shared data is limited strictly to what is necessary for enabling AI responses, and no personal information or Instagram credentials are shared.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Only a limited number of recent chat messages are stored, excluding any identifying information. All stored data is kept securely and protected from unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Users can delete their account or revoke access at any time, upon which all stored chat messages associated with their account will be permanently deleted from our system.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Instagram Graph API (for automation features)</li>
      <li>OpenAI (for AI-powered response generation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is intended for users who already use Instagram and is <b>not</b> designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      For any privacy-related questions, concerns, or requests to delete your data, please contact us at:<br>
      <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:dudi84194@gmail.com">dudi84194@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and continued use of the app after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
